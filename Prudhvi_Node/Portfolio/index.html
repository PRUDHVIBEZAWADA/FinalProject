        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely held to be one of the greatest and most influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, I also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished in the first decades of the twentieth century. I received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for my services to theoretical physics, and especially for my discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. My work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. In a 1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was ranked the greatest physicist of all time. My intellectual achievements and originality have made the word Einstein broadly synonymous with genius.Best known for developing the theory of relativity, I also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics acc.</p>
